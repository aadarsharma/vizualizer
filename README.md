Hereâ€™s a basic template for a `README.md` file that explains how to set up your project locally. This README assumes that your project is divided into a **frontend** (React) and a **backend** (Go) and walks a new user through setting it up on their local machine.

### `README.md`

```md
# Vizualizer

**Vizualizer** is a web application that visualizes sorting algorithms. The frontend is built using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, while the backend is developed using **Go (Golang)**. The backend provides the sorting logic, and the frontend visualizes each step of the sorting process.

## Features

- Visualizes sorting algorithms like Quick Sort and Bubble Sort.
- Adjustable sorting speed.
- Step-by-step visualization of the sorting process.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Go (Golang)
- **Deployment:** Node.js for frontend and Go for backend

## Getting Started

To set up the project locally, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher): [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Go** (v1.16 or higher): [Download Go](https://golang.org/dl/)

## Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Vizualizer.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the backend directory:

   ```bash
   cd Vizualizer/backend
   ```

3. Initialize Go modules:

   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

4. Run the Go server:

   ```bash
   go run cmd/server/main.go
   ```

The backend server will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

### Endpoints

- `POST /sort`: Receives an array and the sorting algorithm (`quick_sort` or `bubble_sort`) and returns the step-by-step sorting process.

## Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```bash
   cd Vizualizer/frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The frontend will start on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Environment Variables

If you need to set environment variables (e.g., for API endpoints), create a `.env` file in the **frontend** directory with the following structure:

```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

## Running the Project

1. **Backend**: Ensure that the Go backend server is running on `http://localhost:8080`.
2. **Frontend**: Ensure that the React development server is running on `http://localhost:3000`.

You can now interact with the application by opening `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## License

### Explanation:
- **Overview**: The README gives a brief description of the project and its tech stack.
- **Backend Setup**: Detailed steps on how to set up and run the Go backend.
- **Frontend Setup**: Instructions on how to set up and run the React frontend.
- **Environment Variables**: A section on how to set up environment variables (if required).
- **License**: A placeholder for license information.

### Adjustments:
Make sure to replace `"yourusername"` with your actual GitHub username in the repository URL in the `git clone` command.

You can also add additional sections as needed, such as **Contributing** if you want others to contribute to your project.

Let me know if you need more details or adjustments!
